# Full Description

**Unlock text from anywhere on the web!**

OCR Extension is a powerful, privacy-focused tool that lets you extract text from images, videos, PDF viewers, and protected websites where simple copy-pasting is blocked.

Unlike other tools that send your screenshots to a cloud server, this extension runs **Tesseract.js completely within your browser**. Your data stays on your device.

## Key Features:

🚀 **Instant Capture**:
Simply verify the extension icon or use `Ctrl+Shift+S` and draw a box around any text.

🔒 **Privacy First**:
No images are sent to external servers. All OCR processing happens locally using WebAssembly technology.

📝 **Advanced Text Reconstruction**:
Smart algorithms fix broken lines, remove noise, and reconstruct paragraphs—perfect for extracting text from comic bubbles (Manhwa/Manga) or column-based layouts.

🌐 **Built-in Translation**:
Instantly translate captured text into your language using the integrated Bing Translator shim.

🎛️ **Powerful Editing**:
A feature-rich popup allows you to:
- Edit text before copying
- Toggle "Manhwa Mode" for vertical text support
- Convert case (UPPERCASE/lowercase)
- Remove whitespace/formatting

Works on:
- YouTube videos
- Comic reader sites (Webtoons, etc.)
- Protected documents
- Canvas elements
- Flash/Game content

**Permissions:**
- Access your data for all websites: Necessary to capture the screenshot of the active tab for text extraction.
